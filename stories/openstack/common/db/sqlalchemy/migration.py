    SQLite abilities to alter tables are very limited (please read
    http://www.sqlite.org/lang_altertable.html for more details).
    E. g. one can't drop a column or a constraint in SQLite. The
    workaround for this is to recreate the original table omitting
    the corresponding constraint (or column).

    sqlalchemy-migrate library has recreate_table() method that
    implements this workaround, but it does it wrong:

        - information about unique constraints of a table
          is not retrieved. So if you have a table with one
          unique constraint and a migration adding another one
          you will end up with a table that has only the
          latter unique constraint, and the former will be lost

        - dropping of unique constraints is not supported at all

    The proper way to fix this is to provide a pull-request to
    sqlalchemy-migrate, but the project seems to be dead. So we
    can go on with monkey-patching of the lib at least for now.
